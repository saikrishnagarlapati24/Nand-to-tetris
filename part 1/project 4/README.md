This project introduces the machine language in which this computer will be programmed and also the working of peripheral devices of the computer such as screen and keyboard and 
how they are associated/mapped with the RAM of the machine. As this is a 16-bit computer, each machine instruction consists of 16-bit word with some semantic meaning attached to
it. 
We write two machine level programs one of which fills the screen with black color(turns on all the pixels of the screen) upon pressing a keyoard key. Another program which 
multiplies the numbers present in RAM addresses 0 and 1 and stores the product in RAM address 2.
