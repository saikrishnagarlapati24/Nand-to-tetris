Part 1 is a collection of 6 individual projects which together bulid the Hardware layer of the computer whose name is HACK. First 5 projets themselves actually 
complete the building of the computer. 
In project 4 we learn about the Machine language of the computer. The machine language of a computer is used to write programs in machine instructions where each instruction is a 
16-bit binary word. These instructions are directly executed by the hack computer chip. Assembly language is nothing but mnemonic form of the raw machine language. 
Assembly language stands at the same heirarchical level as that of machine langauage in terms of semantics. Assembly language is just human-understandable form of machine language 
where we encode each machine instruction using english alphabet and words that are more understandable. A single assembly instruction is translated to only a single machine 
instruction. A single assembly instruction cannot do more than what a single machine instruction can do. 
In project 6 we actually write an assembler program whose job is to take an assembly program file as input and decode each of the assembly instruction into 16-bit machine instruction and thus output a machine language program file.
