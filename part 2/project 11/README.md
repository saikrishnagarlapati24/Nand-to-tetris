This project finishes up the front-end of our compiler, and the building of compiler itself by adding VM code writing feature to the Jack syntax analyzer program in project 10.
This program actually transaltes the high level jack commands into the vm language commands and outputs the vm files along with the two xml files in project 10. This completes the
building of the compiler of the computer.
