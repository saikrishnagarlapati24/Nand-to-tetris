This project introduces the high-level programming language used on the computer, Jack, an oject-oriented language which has most of the basic functionality that Java has and is 
similar to it. 
This project is building a creative interactive application using Jack language. I created a game called catch in which three U-shaped objects fall one after the other, whom we
have to fit each into the previous object. Finally a ball falls down which has to be caught in the basket. Each oject can be moved in air using arrows.
